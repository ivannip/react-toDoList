This toDoList is a pilot application written as a POC for web application development using MERN during my job

1. The backend-api is the module of RESTFUL API
2. The routes/dataRoutes.js has lines of code which could use either mongoDB or memory as data storage
3. The frontend application is developed by REACT and PrimeReact framewwork
4. The application is deployed to Render which could be accessed by https://react-todolist0x.onrender.com
